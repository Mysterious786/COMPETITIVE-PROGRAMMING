//1. Calculate the xor of all elements
//2. If two xor having same bit then the result is 0 whereas viceversa
// 1^0 = 1
// 0^0 = 0
//1^1 = 0
//Now if we didnt got 0 after xor that means at some position the bit might have differ producing a set bit 
//  Now any first bit set or last bit set
// Now make two bucket first and second
//Do the xor start from 0 with & of that numbers
