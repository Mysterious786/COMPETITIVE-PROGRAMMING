//A number that can be divisible by one or itself is know as a prime number;
//Every Prime Number can be represented as 6n-1 or 6n+1
//Except 2 and 3 for the above case
//2 and 3 are onlly consecutive prime number
// 1 cannot be either prime or composite
//GOLDBACH Conjecture : Every even integer greater than 2 can be expreseed as the sum of two prime number
//Why to check upto square root of number
// ---------------------Check Prime-------------------
//         -------------Naive Approach ------------------
